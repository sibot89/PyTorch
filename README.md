# PyTorch
Using PyTorch for Implementing Machin Learning Projects
In this repo I create some machine learning models for some problems.
-> In Iris_classification_problem we want to use PyTorch to classify the Iris dataset. I apply the nn.Linear model for creating a linear model and nn.CrossEntropyLos for caculating the loss value. The optimizer is SGD with learning_rate = 0.01 and mumentum = 0.5
